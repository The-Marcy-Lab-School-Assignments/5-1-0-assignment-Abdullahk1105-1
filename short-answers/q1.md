# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Instance methods are created as regular functions, instance properties are created in a constructor. Methods/properties are used when you are creating a new instance using the `new` keyword. Class methods and properties are both created using the `static` keyword. Class methods and properties are used on the class itself and not the instance.

This is correct just want to give you some feedback on your technical communication. We really didn't get this detailed in class so don't worry about it.

- Instance methods and properties are defined in the constructor function of a class. Each instance of the class has its own copy of these methods and properties.

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name; // Instance property
  }
  
  bark() { // Instance method
    console.log(`${this.name} barks!`);
  }
}
```

>_note_: the `class` keyword is abstracting the constructor function, which saves  the class itself in memory. Classes are essentially syntactic sugar over constructor functions. This also abstracts the need to use `prototype` to add instance methods to the class.
