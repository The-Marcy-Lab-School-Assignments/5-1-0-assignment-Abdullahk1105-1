# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Instance methods are created as regular functions, instance properties are created in a constructor. Methods/properties are used when you are creating a new instance using the `new` keyword. Class methods and properties are both created using the `static` keyword. Class methods and properties are used on the class itself and not the instance.
